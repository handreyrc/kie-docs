As a developer of business decisions, your understanding of the {DECISION_ENGINE} in {PRODUCT} can help you design more effective business assets and a more scalable decision management architecture. The {DECISION_ENGINE} is the {PRODUCT} component that stores, processes, and evaluates data to execute business rules and to reach the decisions that you define. This document describes basic concepts and functions of the {DECISION_ENGINE} to consider as you create your business rule system and decision services in {PRODUCT}.
