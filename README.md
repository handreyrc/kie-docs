# Kogito documentation

<p align="center"><img width=55% height=55% src="_images/logos/kogitoLogo.png"_></p>

Kogito is a cloud-native business automation technology for building cloud-ready business applications. Kogito includes components that are based on well-known business automation projects in the Knowledge Is Everything (KIE) community, specifically [Drools](https://drools.org), [jBPM](https://jbpm.org), and [OptaPlanner](https://optaplanner.org), to offer dependable, open source solutions for business rules, business processes, and constraint solving.

This `master-kogito` branch of the `kie-docs` repository contains the source of the Kogito documentation for both KIE community and Red Hat Business Automation enterprise publications. The latest version of the Kogito documentation for the KIE community is published at https://docs.jboss.org/kogito/release/latest/html_single/. 

As a Kogito user, developer, or technical writer, you can contribute to Kogito documentation by forking and cloning this repository, updating or adding content, and submitting a pull request for review.

>**NOTE**: The other branches in the `kie-docs` repository contain the source of the Drools, jBPM, and OptaPlanner documentation, which are the basis for [Red Hat Decision Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_decision_manager/) and [Red Hat Process Automation Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_process_automation_manager/).

>**IMPORTANT**: Kogito is currently available for Development Preview. Development Preview releases contain features and APIs that might not be fully tested and that might change in the final GA version. Users are discouraged from using Development Preview software in production or for business-critical workloads.  Because this is not production-ready software, users are not able to open support tickets. To learn more about Kogito, please contact your Red Hat representative or send an email to Kogito-earlyaccess@redhat.com. Red Hat will address reported issues at its own discretion.
